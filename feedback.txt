Feedback for this lecture.
I very love current teaching style more than before.
Before this. It very rush. I just reading the code and try to understand that. 
You said giv 5min for this code and you rapidly scroll up and down to check the code. @_@
then stop just a moment and time's up.
But now, I got more time. Learn the code together. Show the solution for all lab and assignment is very good. 
That let me know what is my mistake and how to make it better.

I love it. thank you
